####  Q1. Beta-bernoulli Naive Bayes  ####

This code is about Question 1 in the Pattern Recognition CA-1. Our purpose is to plot the training and test error rates versus a and get the training and testing error rates for a = 1,10, 100.

There are three ‘.mat’ files. The ‘Classifer1.m’ is our purpose file. The other two files, ‘Thetajc.m’ and ‘binarization.m’, are two functions used in ‘Classifer1.m’.


##Instructions to run code##

Must add the project data file-‘spamData.mat’ into document firstly.
Just "Run" it and get the results.
